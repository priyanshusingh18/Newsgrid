            <p>Failure</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="bold-1">
            The photo above is of a very dumb guy from a small town Ashoknagar, the story of this guy's failure is a cautionary tale for students all across the world. His name is Dev Raghuwanshi a very dumb guy, His ambition was to crack JEE exam and stufy in a prestigious University like IIT, NIT, NSUIT, BITS etc. Dev did not factor his mental calibar into the equation when he took the decision of pursuing this exam. <br> <br></p>
          <p class="bold-1">His tale started when he was in last year of school, that's when he decided to pursue IIT. In hindsight it is very obvious that he was gonna fail but he though he can crack the exam
             if he just workd hard and out his best effort.He was never among the toppers of any class, yet he thought he can clear one of the thoughest exam in India.
             He even failed in 10+1 courtesy to playing to much pubg with his really smart friend Priyanshu, who is a very smart guy. Priyanshu was the topper of their shcool, and he was smart enough to suggest dev to stop pursuing IIT,
             but dev being stubborn did not listen to him, and continued his pursuit of the impossible. Dev spends most his time listeing to music, wathcing movies or playing games, and yet he thinks he can clear JEE advance.
             Dev only scored about 74% in his boards exam of matric, and his junior highschool score was about 57 percent, but he lied to his friends, telling them that he actually scored 58 percent. He is also very determined to get into IIT,
             he has failed 5 times, and still continues to belive he can crack IIT. <br><br>
             Every One should choose challenges acording to their calibar, this is the biggest learing someone can take from this story.
